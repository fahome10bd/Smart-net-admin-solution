Controlling internet connection automatically according to specified time of use and data limit Controlling internet \
connection automatically according to specified time of use and data limit. This code builds a graphical user interface \
to easily control internet access.Input taken from user: time limit: (minutes/seconds), Data limit: (Kb/Mb) The window \
shows Upload speed, Download speed, Spent time, Used amount of data Features of the GUI: Once the GUI is started \
it automatically controls the internet connection and can switch them on/off according to user limit. As soon as the  \
limit is reached, the GUI turns off the internet connection with no delay. There is a flag that shows the current state  
of internet accessibility. 

MATLAB codes:  \
Get_html_data.py: Acquires current internet status of the device and gives feedback. \
